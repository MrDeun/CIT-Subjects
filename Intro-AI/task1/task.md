1. Create a set of cities (as points) with coordinates x, y on a plane with height as z coordinate. The cost of going from city A to city B is equal to the Euclidean distance between two cities, if there exists a road. You should define scenarios according to two criteria:

a. There are all the direct connections / c.a. 80% of possible connections

b. The problem is symmetrical / asymmetrical (in asymmetrical – going up is height +10%, going down: -10%)

You should choose the coordinates randomly from the range <-100, 100> for x,y and <0, 50> for z.

2. Represent the created map as a weighted (directed) graph, where cities are the nodes and roads are the edges of the graph.

3. In the created scene, solve the traveling salesman problem: The salesman starts from a chosen city and has to visit every city exactly once before returning to the starting city. The goal is to find a path with the lowest cost.

In the problem, we define state as a partial or full path from the starting city and the corresponding state. You should represent the search problem in a form of state tree.

a. Implement a full search of the tree, using BFS and DFS methods.

b. Approximate the solution using greedy search (NN and Dijkstra)

c. Solve/approximate the solution using A* with inadmissible/admissible heuristics

d. Approximate the solution using ACO algorithm

4. Test each algorithm, in each scenario, for n=5…20 cities, in terms of the found path cost, time and memory consumption.
